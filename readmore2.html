  <p>
    CSS beginners should first understand the box model, as every HTML element is treated as a box with margin, padding, and border.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using classes instead of IDs makes the code reusable and easier to manage. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Flexbox should be learned early because it helps in creating responsive and well-aligned layouts.
  </p>
  <p>
     Beginners should avoid using fixed heights and widths to prevent layout issues on different screen sizes.
  </p>
  <p>
     Keeping the design simple with limited colors and readable fonts improves the appearance of a website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding hover effects enhances user interaction, and commenting the CSS code helps in better understanding and maintenance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regular practice through small projects is the best way to improve CSS skills.
